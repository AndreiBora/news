            <h2><b>RBS is closing 259 branches - one in four of its outlets - and cutting 680 jobs as more customers bank online.</b></h2>
            <p>The closures involve 62 Royal Bank of Scotland and 197 NatWest branches.<br><br>
              RBS, which is 71%-owned by the taxpayer, said it would try to ensure compulsory redundancies were "kept to an absolute minimum".<br><br>
              The bank said use of its branches by customers had fallen 40% since 2014, but the Unite union, which represents bank staff, called the cuts "savage".<br><br>
              Following the closures, the RBS group will be left with 744 branches.<br><br></p>
              <h2>Analysis: Kevin Peachey, personal finance reporter</h2>
              <p>RBS, like many of its competitors, says that branch use has dropped dramatically as people bank on the go.
                Industry analysts CACI forecasts that typical consumers will only visit a bank branch four times a year by 2022, as virtually all transactions or paperwork can be done online, or by letter or at a post office.
                Yet visiting a branch remains a way of life for many people - older people and small businesses particularly. A report into branch closures by Professor Russel Griggs likened losing a local branch to a "bereavement" for some people.</p>
              {% load static %}<img src="{% static 'img/branchclose.jpg'%}" alt="">
              <p>Paul Wheelhouse, Scottish Government Minister for Business, Innovation and Energy, said: "The news of further branch closures from RBS will be hugely concerning to many people in Scotland as it now not only affects, potentially, staff at RBS but also leaves large areas of Scotland, particularly rural areas, with limited branch coverage.<br><br>
                "While recognising that footfall in branches is falling, due to online banking, RBS, and other banks, must take into account the needs of all customers - not just those who can access and use digital services."<br><br>
                The news comes as RBS continues its rehabilitation from its state-backed bailout in 2008, prompted by the financial crisis.<br><br>
                On Thursday, it said it had closed its so-called "bad bank", which was set up to handle toxic assets stemming from the crisis.<br><br>
                Earlier this week, RBS passed the Bank of England stress tests, having failed in 2016.<br><br>
                In last week's Budget, the government revived plans to sell down its stake in the bank, aiming to sell Â£15bn of its shares by 2023.<br><br></p>
