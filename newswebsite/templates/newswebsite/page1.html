            <h2><b>Zimbabwe's new President Emmerson Mnangagwa has named his cabinet, appointing senior military figures to high-profile positions.</b></h2>
            <p>Critics have said that it has dashed hopes of change in the country.<br><br>
              Mr Mnangagwa was inaugurated as president last week. He took over from Robert Mugabe who had been in power for 37 years.<br><br>
              Mr Mugabe stepped down after the army took control of the country, following a power struggle in the ruling party.<br><br>
              Thousands of people celebrated Mr Mugabe's resignation as they hoped the failed economy would improve.<br><br>
              Some had hoped that President Mnangagwa would appoint members of the opposition to his cabinet, to form a transitional government until elections next year but this did not happen.<br><br></p>
              <h2>What has been the reaction?</h2>
              <p>The appointments led government critic Tendai Biti to suggest that Zimbabweans were "wrong" to have hoped for change."Up until now, we had given the putsch the benefit of the doubt. We did so in the genuine, perhaps naive view that the country could actually move forward. We craved change, peace & stability in our country. How wrong we were," he said.</p>
              {%load static %} <img src="{% static 'img/celebrate.jpg' %}" alt="">

              <p>Wilf Mbanga, a Zimbabwean journalist who lives in exile in South Africa, told the BBC that the new minister of agriculture Perence Shiri "was not known for his love of democracy".<br><br>
A minister who served in Mr Mugabe's government, Jonathan Moyo, said the changes meant that Zanu-PF, the party which has governed Zimbabwe since independence in 1980, was "dead" and the military was now in charge.<br><br>
Newspaper owner Trevor Ncube said the cabinet was "very disappointing".
"Largely the same people that caused this crisis have been recycled. The honeymoon comes to an end and reality dawns. His concern seems to have been rewarding those who brought him to power and Zanu-PF unity," he said.<br><br></p>
